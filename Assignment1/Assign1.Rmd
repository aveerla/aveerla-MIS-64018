## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }

chooseCRANmirror(graphics = getOption("menu.graphics"), ind = 79,
                 local.only = FALSE)
install.packages("vcd")
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

#DataSetSource: https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html

MathEnrollment <- read.csv("MathEnrollment.csv")
View(MathEnrollment)

#summary of Math Enrollment
summary(MathEnrollment)
#Arranging in order based on Fall
arrange(MathEnrollment, Fall)
#Arranging in desc order
arrange(MathEnrollment, desc(Fall))
#Calculating Mean 
mean(MathEnrollment$Fall)
#Calculating Median
median(MathEnrollment$Spring)
select(MathEnrollment, AYear:Spring)
summary(MathEnrollment)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
#Plotting Graphs for Year and Fall

plot(MathEnrollment$AYear, MathEnrollment$Fall)
#Plotting Graphs for Year and Spring

plot(MathEnrollment$AYear, MathEnrollment$Spring)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
